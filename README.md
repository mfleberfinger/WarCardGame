# WarCardGame
The card game "War" simulated in a terminal or a WPF GUI.

The /Terminal directory contains a text based version of the game that was mostly made for testing purposes.

The /Visual directory contains a version of the game that has been modified to run as a .NET WPF application.

Playing the text based version of the game:
  - Run the .exe file included in the /Terminal directory
    + the executable should work on Windows with .NET or on Linux with Mono
  - Follow the on screen prompts
    + the "auto option will play the game from the current state to the end
    
    
Playing the graphical version of the game:
  - Run the .exe file included in the /Visual directory
  - Click the "Next" button to draw cards.
  - Click the Next button again to determine who won the round.
  - If the round was a tie, a "war" will start and clicking Next will draw the next cards for the war.
  - Continue clicking next to play through the game.
  - The number of cards in each deck is shown over the decks in the corners of the window.
  - Click "Reset" to start a new game.
